Materials for Oxford Software Engineering Programme CLO course: Cloud Computing and Big Data
A 5 day hands-on introduction to building scalable big data systems in the cloud

There are lectures and lab exercises. The lab exercises are usually done half on a VM and half in the Cloud on AWS. 
However, they can all be done in AWS if necessary running the image in the cloud (though I haven't actually tried this model).
